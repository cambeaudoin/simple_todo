# simple_todo
This is a simple todo app that was built with the mean stack

It is based off the scotch.io "Single page to-do app" found here:
 -https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular  
 -https://scotch.io/tutorials/node-and-angular-to-do-app-application-organization-and-structure  
 -https://scotch.io/tutorials/node-and-angular-to-do-app-controllers-and-services  

I say "based off" because there are significant alterations made so that this can be used as a training exercise for those wanting to learn the MEAN stack
